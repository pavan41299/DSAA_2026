Submissions failing to comply with paper formatting and authors anonymity will be rejected without reviews.

              Because of the double-blind review process, non-anonymous papers that have been issued as technical reports or similar cannot be considered for DSAA&apos;2026. An exception to this rule applies to arXiv papers that were published in arXiv at least a month prior to DSAA&apos;2026 submission deadline. Authors can submit these arXiv papers to DSAA provided that the submitted paper&apos;s title and abstract are different from the one appearing in arXiv.

Authors can provide an optional two (2) page supplement at the end of their submitted paper (it needs to be in the same PDF file after the paper&apos;s references). This supplement can only be used to include (i) information necessary for reproducing the experimental results reported in the paper (e.g., various algorithmic and model parameters and configurations, hyper-parameter search spaces, details related to dataset filtering and train/test splits, software versions, detailed hardware configuration, etc.), and (ii) any data, pseudo-code and proofs that due to space limitations, could not be included in the main manuscript.</li>
