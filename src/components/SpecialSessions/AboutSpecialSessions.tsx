            The DSAA&apos; 2026 track brings together researchers, industry experts, practitioners, and potential
            users who are interested in cultivating specialized and important aspects of data

            Special Sessions are intended to include and promote emerging data science
            research areas that are not yet well established and covered in the main
            conference tracks, while featuring high quality papers. The same evaluation
            criteria and quality level apply as for the main conference, but papers must
            adhere to the scope of the special session, and reviewers will be experts in
            that area.

            <li>Once a special session proposal has been accepted, its organizers should create a website with the Special Session information and should widely publicize the session’s call for papers on different mailing lists and social media</li>
            <li>Special session papers strictly follow the same specifications, requirements, and policies as the main conference submissions in terms of the paper submission deadline, notification deadline, paper formatting and length, important policies, and publication of accepted papers in the proceedings.</li>
            <li>Reviewing the submissions in each special session is coordinated by the special session organizers, but the process of reviewing is fully aligned to the main conference evaluation process. In particular:</li>
            <ol>
              <li>•	All papers submitted to special sessions will be double-blind reviewed.</li>
              <li>•	Organizers of each special session will select the program committee (PC) members.</li>
              <li>•	PC members will be invited into the submission system for each Special Session; a reviewer can serve as PC member in more than one Special Session.</li>
              <li>•	Papers will then be assigned to appropriate PC members for review.</li>
              <li>•	Special Session organizers will make recommendations of acceptance/rejection for papers in their sessions, which must be validated by the Special Session Chairs</li>
            </ol>
            <li>To guarantee uniform quality control for all special sessions and to be consistent with the main conference, the final decisions of special session paper acceptance/rejection are made by the DSAA Program Chairs.</li>
