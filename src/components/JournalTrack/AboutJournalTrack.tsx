              The DSAA&apos;2026 Special Track on Large Language Models (LLMs) solicits high-quality, original papers presenting novel issues and innovative insights into all facets of LLMs and their applications in data science, including but not limited to science and algorithms of LLMs, enlarged language models, retrieval-augmented text generation, vision-language pretraining, multimodal LLMs, finetuning, inference, and risk mitigation, alongside trustworthiness and societal implications of LLMs. Papers accepted to the Special Track on Large Language Models will be published in the DSAA&apos;2026 conference proceedings (same as for the Research Track, and Application, Data and Benchmark Track).

              All submissions will be blind reviewed by the Program Committee for the Special Track on Large Language Models on the basis of technical quality, relevance to the conference&apos;s topics of interest, originality, significance, and clarity. Author names and affiliations must not appear in the submissions, and bibliographic references must be adjusted to preserve author anonymity. Submissions failing to comply with paper formatting and authors anonymity will be rejected without reviews.

              Because of the double-blind review process, non-anonymous papers that have been issued as technical reports or similar cannot be considered for DSAA&apos;2026. An exception to this rule applies to arXiv papers that were published in arXiv at least a month prior to DSAA&apos;2026 submission deadline. Authors can submit these arXiv papers to DSAA provided that the submitted paper&apos;s title and abstract are different from the one appearing in arXiv.

Authors can provide an optional two (2) page supplement at the end of their submitted paper (it needs to be in the same PDF file after the paper&apos;s references). This supplement can only be used to include (i) information necessary for reproducing the experimental results reported in the paper, and (ii) any data, pseudo-code and proofs that due to space limitations, could not be included in the main manuscript.</li>
